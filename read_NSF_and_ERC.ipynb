The theme of the 2022 Annual Conference is Biodiversity, Conservation Science, and Climate Change and will be held virtually on June 21-24, 2022. The Conference will explore the complex interactions between biodiversity and climate change, and how these complexities factor into conservation strategies to protect global biodiversity. A main goal of the conference is to reframe the \"tipping points\" dialogue to emphasize the necessity for regenerative thinking, solution creation and action.  The conference will highlight success stories in conservation that should help guide us toward discovering more science and evidence-based solutions to conservation challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the GCSE 2022 Annual Conference, Biodiversity, Conservation Science, and Climate Change, encourages scientists, decision-makers, civil society leaders and practitioners, and youth to rethink the traditional \"tipping points\" narrative in order to address crucial issues impacting biodiversity conservation and climate change. The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it abundantly clear that humanity is rapidly running out of time to confront the climate crisis before global warming makes conserving global biodiversity much harder&#8212;if not impossible. The central objective of the conference, is to identify practical ways to engage in regenerative decision spaces regarding climate solutions that protect life on earth and ensure a sustainable and resilient future for humanity itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF\\'s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation\\'s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', \"Research is increasingly dependent upon Cyberinfrastructure (CI), from instruments and sensors to Research Computing and Data (RCD) infrastructure and services. High Performance Computing (HPC) is an important element, however RCD has expanded well beyond HPC into secure enclaves for data compliance; big data management, analytics, and movement; AI/machine learning; and more recently into heterogeneous compute models, edge computing, and cloud-based computing. Researchers are struggling to keep pace with the explosion of data and the rapid evolution of computing resources, and often lack the skills to make full use of emerging tools and techniques. Developing and maintaining the needed expertise takes valuable time from research and is often beyond the capacity of researchers; they must depend upon partners (RCD professionals) who combine technology expertise and an understanding of research workflows and researcher needs. Institutions face challenges recruiting and retaining RCD professional staff, and building effective RCD support services. This CI CoE Demonstration Pilot (RCD CoE) will develop an RCD Resource and Career Center to advance and enable the nation's capacity for computational and data-intensive research by providing institutions and individuals the products, tools, services, and community to build and sustain successful RCD operations.  The project will also provide expertise in the development of new RCD professionals, and provide a voice and a connector for the broad community and the profession at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCD Resource and Career Center will build upon work that the NSF-supported Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) has done and continues to do to develop products and tools for effective RCD support. The Center will develop a robust and sustainable implementation of the RCD Capabilities Model that provides an assessment framework, support for benchmarking and strategic planning, and a community data set to understand the landscape of RCD support. The Center will expand and disseminate resources for RCD Professionalization, including support for adoption of an RCD Job Family Matrix to properly classify RCD professional roles and conducting a national census of RCD Professionals to characterize the current state of RCD staff and programs. The Center will create and disseminate a model of Career Arcs for RCD Professionals to explain career options and help existing RCD professionals explore professional development and advancement. Work in the project will aggregate resources for staff training and workforce development, including leading practices for recruitment, onboarding, advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and professional development, as well as proven models for student internship and training programs. The pilot period and the community of communities will be used to facilitate the creation of a coordinating organization to connect all the relevant communities and to develop a shared voice for RCD professionals as the project plans for a full Center of Excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"]\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', \"Head and heart development are closely intertwined during embryonic development in vertebrates. They share molecular regulatory mechanism as well as some progenitor cell populations. Both head and heart, are made from a multitude of cells, which include mesodermal cells that form musculature and neural crest cells which form connective tissue. Mesodermal and neural crest cells are also important for the development of cartilages and bones in head and neck and for proper septation of the heart. The identity of cells that constitute these tissues is specified very early during embryogenesis via a specific set of genes (specifiers), then follow their trajectory to become muscle, connective tissue, etc.&lt;br/&gt;One early specifier, gastrulation-brain-homeobox 2 (Gbx2), is essential for the migration (movement) and survival of neural crest cells. Neural crest cells and mesodermal cells interact during their migration to form head and heart structures. While mesodermal cells are not directly effected by change in Gbx2 expression, neural crest cells are effected and will alter the communication with mesodermal cells, leading to changes in mesoderm derived structures (e.g., muscles). This project aims to understand how Gbx2 guides neural crest development, and how changes in Gbx2 expression influences head (muscle, cartilage, bone, cranial nerve) and heart development. &lt;br/&gt;Traditionally the fields of comparative, developmental and evolutionary biology have been unsuccessful in recruiting students and scientists of diverse backrounds. This project will promote collaborations between researchers from non-traditional backgrounds in these areas of biology and historically black universities, Howard University and University of the District of Columbia.  This award is funded by the NSF Excellence in Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical paragraph&lt;br/&gt;Cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) are involved in the development of cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, cranium, connective tissue of head muscles, heart septation, pharyngeal arch artery development, etc. The gastrulation-brain-homeobox (Gbx) transcription factor family member, Gbx2, regulates diverse developmental processes, including anteroposterior patterning within the anterior hindbrain and migration and survival of CNCCs. Since CNCCs are involved in many different developmental processes during head and heart development, this project aims to analyze target genes under direct control of Gbx2, that regulate migration and survival of CNCCs in homozygous Gbx2neo embryos. Furthermore, this project will include analyses of the impact of changes of Gbx2 expression on the morphogenesis of the neural system, and craniofacial and cardiovascular structures. The latter part is of significance as neural crest cells influence the development and differentiation of surrounding tissues and vice versa. During head and haert development the interaction of CNCCs and mesoderm is of particular interest for this project because the mesodermal progenitor cells for most of the head and heart musculature derives from a common progenitor field, called the cardiopharyngeal field. In case Gbx2 is somehow involved in the gene regulatory network underlying the differentiation of that mesodermal progenitor field, directly via altering the transcription of genes or indirectly via altering the neural crest - mesodermal interaction during development, this project will lead to insights into mechanisms regulating head and heart development as well as cranial ganglia and nerve development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"]\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', \"Calderon-Zygmund operators are objects that are largely responsible for our understanding of a number of physical phenomena, from heat transfer to turbulence. Recently, these operators have found application in big data analysis. The classical theory was built by Alberto Calderon and Antoni Zygmund in the early 1950s, and was intrinsically designed to work on smooth objects. However, nature often puzzles us with very irregular medium. Thus, the need arose for a very low regularity Calderon-Zygmund theory, which the three PIs have, in fact, constructed. One possible application of such low regularity theory is that by the action of Calderon-Zygmund operators on a set in a space of a very high dimension, we can conclude that the set itself is nicely structured and can be analyzed. This is a typical big data problem. Our other recent observation is that well-studied problems for such an operator can be dualized to provide new information for analysis on the hypercube - another widely used model of big data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will consider the following problems, presented here in their simplest by formulation: 1) Sharp end-point weak weighted estimates for the square function operator in the homogeneous setting; 2) What goes wrong in the non-homogeneous case; 3) Matrix A_2 problems for Calderon--Zygmund operators, the square function operator, their sparse operators analogies and their sharp estimates; 4) How to get from end-point estimates of the square function to geometric inequalities on the hypercube and in Gaussian space; 5) The David-Semmes problem for co-dimension higher than one; 6) Harmonic measure estimates on sets of co-dimension bigger than one; and 7) Estimates from below of singular Riesz transforms by positive geometric quantities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"]\n",

Professor Watson is developing methods that allow for the synthesis of new organic molecules that contain silicon atoms. These types of molecules have broad application to both chemical synthesis and the development of consumer products such as plastics, non-stick coatings, and personal care products. The methodology being pursued by Professor Watson and his students is enabling the synthesis of these important products from simple, cheap, and readily available starting materials. Professor Watson is also developing an integrated undergraduate research program that provides students from underrepresented groups the opportunity to pursue cutting-edge chemical research. This program is allowing students to better connect with their field of study, offering them increased opportunities for mentorship, and developing their research skills so that they can excel in either graduate school or their future employment. In addition, Professor Watson and his research group are engaging in outreach activities that introduce preschool and early school age children to the chemical sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Donald A Watson and his research group are examining the use of electrophilic silicon reagents (silyl halides and triflates) with carbon nucleophiles using nickel and palladium catalysis. The Watson group is seeking improved methods for the synthesis of hindered alkyl-, allyl-, and vinyl-silanes using straightforward cross-coupling approaches. The goal of this effort is to increase the scope of these transformations compared to known processes, increase reactivity though the design of new catalytic systems, and to explore the mechanisms of the transformations we develop. Professor Watson and his group are also exploring stereocontrol in these reactions using asymmetric catalysts. In total, this program is leading to new, powerful, and useful methods for organosilane synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\"]\n",

The use of complex numbers has been essential in the development of mathematics.  Partial differential equations and several complex variables are employed in string theory and twistor theory, physical theories that try to unify different physical force fields.  The existence and regularity of solutions to such partial differential equations are still not fully understood, and they form some of the most challenging problems in mathematical analysis.  The current study is not only important for the development of mathematics, but it may lead to new understanding of physical phenomena as well, with potential applications in other sciences and technology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on some of the most important equations in several complex variables, the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the induced tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.  The topics investigated in this research project include function theory on complex manifolds, Hausdorff property of Dolbeault cohomology groups, Levi-flat hypersurfaces and complex foliation, and the Cauchy-Riemann operators on complex projective spaces and negatively curved manifolds.  Understanding the geometric aspects of these equations under the curvature conditions and their relations with function theory in complex manifolds is a challenging and important problem.  New approaches have been introduced to study these problems which connect the topology of domains in complex manifolds with the topology of Dolbeault cohomology groups.  The study of several complex variables in a geometric setting has provided interesting new questions with fresh insight to problems in topology, foliation theory, complex dynamics, algebraic and complex geometry.  This project aims to deepen understanding in this area.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', 'This mathematics research project concerns the areas of analysis, geometry, and dynamics, which are central to mathematics and crucial to other scientific fields, such as engineering, biology, and economics. For example, the mathematical modeling of any phenomenon that undergoes change over time (such as the population of bacteria in a body, the stock market, etc.) can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for many current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This project will enhance the tools available in these branches of mathematics. The development of geometry goes back to the ancient Greeks, who laid down axioms, or basic assumptions, from which other reasonable properties could be logically deduced. The main focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer valid. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will use techniques from non-Archimedean analysis and geometry in order to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. The project makes use of Berkovich spaces, non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One part of the project involves Calabi-Yau manifolds, geometric objects that play an important role in mathematical physics. The principal investigator and collaborator will use non-Archimedean techniques to study a conjecture concerning one-parameter families of complex Calabi-Yau manifolds that degenerate to a real Calabi-Yau manifold. Another part of the project is in arithmetic dynamics. Given a discrete-time two-dimensional dynamical system defined by a pair of polynomials with rational coefficients, the research investigates how the arithmetic complexity grows along orbits of the dynamics. Here the problem is formulated in terms of elementary number theory but approached using a detailed study of an induced dynamical system on a Berkovich space.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', 'The past few years have seen unprecedented growth in mobile data consumption. Powered in large part by the rapid adoption of smart phones and tablets, the growth in wireless data creates phenomenal challenges for the wireless industry, which has been unable to meet the demand for rich mobile content through cellular networks. This has led to the investigation of solutions by network operators that aim to utilize WiFi radios present in these mobile devices to deliver content without using the cellular radio links, also known as content-offloading.  Industry-led approaches aim to utilize WiFi infrastructure in the form of access points to offload this content, but these have various deployment issues. Research has lately focused on the potential of proximity-based peer content sharing, since proximity enables low-power, high speed data exchanges which in turn allows mobile devices to proactively share data with one another. No large-scale study using real-world situations has established the potential for such content-sharing to provide capacity gains, until now. This proposal aims to conduct solid, preliminary pilot studies evaluating several of the foundational claims in this area, specifically as to whether sufficient potential exists in the right time, right place, and with reasonably viable deployment scenarios. The proposed work will gather and evaluate pilot data in both highly amenable environments (WiFi across multiple tailgate offerings of hundreds of users) as well as more challenging environments (daily commuter trains to / from Chicago).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the work will be to either demonstrate the potential viability for proximity-based solutions or to present compelling evidence that such proximity solutions are unlikely to yield significant benefits. Further broader impacts for the work include data sharing capabilities with respect to temporal characterizations of redundancy across mobile devices in several real-world scenarios.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', 'Management in most practical settings involves a series of decisions that must be made repeatedly under uncertainty over a long period of time. Many of these decisions involve yes/no decisions, as well as decisions regarding appropriate levels of various factors. For many such problems, stochastic mixed-integer programming (SMIP) provides a powerful modeling framework. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art SMIP algorithms cannot solve realistic-sized problems that arise in real-world contexts. This award supports fundamental research aimed at investigating novel approaches that can form a framework for a general-purpose multistage SMIP solver.  The broader impacts of this work will be felt in multiple domains. Should this approach prove successful, a much richer set of models can be solved in a variety of applications arising in healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and so on. The educational impacts will be felt by graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, which is known as scenario-tree decomposition, a novel method will be developed for decomposing the scenario tree of a multistage SMIP, rather than its extensive form. One major advantage of such approach is that it will not require any particular structure. Based on preliminary results and prior work on establishing bounds for two-stage SMIPs, it will be shown that cuts of the scenario tree can generate lower and upper bounds on a multistage SMIP. Moreover, it is hypothesized that a hierarchy among such bounds can be established. These bounds will be incorporated into a global branch-and-bound framework. Furthermore, this approach may be generalized beyond the standard stochastic programming paradigm. For example, it may be amenable to certain classes of nonlinear SMIPs. This method is highly amenable to high-performance computing, and will provide users with an explicit tradeoff between the quality of the bounds and the requisite computational effort.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', 'The objective of this project is to develop an infrastructure for the identification and steering of complex dynamical patterns in networks and spatiotemporal systems, tools for the goal of pattern steering include complex attractor reconstruction, state identification, and appropriate control protocols.  Computational methods for changing the activity of a complex dynamical network from one state to another will be investigated. Complicated nonlinear networks appear to be multi-stable and multi-rhythmic, a mix of chaotic and periodic stable attractors, together with other metastable transients that may be effectively stable for the time interval of an engineering application. Computational methods will be developed to enable steering between these attractors, or dynamical patterns, and to perform this switching quickly and automatically. The project includes theoretical, computational, and experimental components.  In particular, foundational work on adaptive Kalman filtering will be carried out that was motivated by previous exploratory work. Spiking networks with multiple attractors will be studied theoretically and hypotheses tested by simulation, as a proof of concept of steering techniques. Larger networks will be designed as a bridge to experiments. A new data-driven computational method called Diffusion-Mapped Delay Coordinates, a result of previous exploratory study, will be used for steering between basins of attractors. The developed methodologies will be tested in two different experimental platforms, neuronal cell cultures, and convection rolls in nematic liquid crystals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work provides potentially pathbreaking contributions to the analysis and effective control of dynamical and spiking biological, bio-inspired, and more general engineering networks. Better understanding of this test case could be a first step to new approaches to optimization of energy transfer and production. The experimental examples have in common a lack of known equations of motion, which severely limits the use of classical control theory and motivates development of our new techniques. Throughout this study, emphasis will be placed on development of methodologies that generalize widely to other multistable dynamical networks. The project will provide concrete interdisciplinary training for graduate and postdoctoral students, who will be chosen from three different background areas, physics, mathematics, and engineering.']\n",

Intellectually, we aimed to examine an important hypothesis about how neurons in a network coordinate to produce signals that represent environmental stimuli for animals as well as for humans. More specifically, we recorded and analyzed responses of olfactory neurons in an insect model, and correlated the responses with well controlled odor stimuli and olfactory behaviors. All these data were used to benchmark our mathematical model. In addition to contributing new knowledge to the field of olfactory neuroscience, this project also aimed to bring broader impact to education of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in local communities and schools, provide training opportunities to students with variety of socioeconomic background.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intellectual contribution to specialty areas&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neuronal synchrony, a phenomenon that multiple neurons elicit electric charges or spikes simultaneously, is believed to be an important code for stimuli. By characterizing a neural pathway in the male hawkmoth Manduca sexta that processes information about female sex pheromone (a 2-component odor mixture (A+B) in ratio of 2:1), we provided new evidence supporting the synchrony-code hypothesis. A key stage of the neural pathway is a network of neurons residing in the insect&amp;rsquo;s primary olfactory center called antennal lobe, which is equivalent to the olfactory bulb in the vertebrates. A specialized region in the antennal lobe of male moths processes the pheromone. This well-established chemical communication system offers a clear experimental advantage, that is, we can use a simple odor mixture (A+B) that is behaviorally effective. Using a series of odor mixtures deviating systematically from the natural 2:1 (A:B) ratio in wind-tunnel assays deteriorated these insects&amp;rsquo; olfactory behaviors. We then carried out dual recordings from neurons that specifically process these mixtures, and discovered these neurons evoked largest amount of synchronized spikes upon stimulation with the 2:1 ratio. We went one step further, reasoning that if the synchrony-code was important, there must be downstream neurons that can read this code. We therefore recorded from these downstream neurons and challenged them with the same series of odor mixtures. Indeed, some of these neurons, not all of them, generated peak response when stimulated with the 2:1 ratio, corroborating with results from the antennal lobe and behavioral assays. Only with this approach could we establish the link between stimulus, neural response and behavior, all in one system. These results are published in J Comp Physiol A in 2013 (Martin et al., 2013; Lei et al., 2013).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspired by experimental data, my collaborator Dr. Rangan in NYU developed a hybrid framework which combines certain techniques used by standard population-dynamics methods with the explicit use of stochastic methods for dealing with correlations amongst neurons and synchronous-events. Such a framework can be of considerable use not only in neuroscience but in the study of certain types of rare events in many physical systems. More importantly, the process of developing these models turned out to be a journey that mutually benefits both teams, i.e. experimentalists and theoreticians. Data from pharmacological experiments suggested a strong heterogeneity of inhibitory control in the special region of antennal lobe that processes sex pheromone; a model of multi-layer formulations not only explained the experimental observations but also predicted a particular phenomenon, namely run-away synchrony, in the other regions of the antennal lobe; these predictions were later confirmed with more experimental recordings. This process of discovery demonstrates a true collaboration between biologists and mathematicians, which is perhaps a key aspect of NSF collaborative programs.

While most Humanitarian Supply Chain (HSC) related research has focused on the distribution and stocking of relief supplies or location of supply centers, in sharp contrast, issues surrounding donations management (i.e., the solicitation, coordination, distribution and management of donated goods, money and services that form inputs into the HSC) and its impact on the downstream relief recipient have been unexplored, particularly for food distribution. This research focuses on the development of predictive models to (1) characterize donor behavior, (2) quantify supply availability and (3) determine the equitable allocation of constrained supply.  The models will account for the complexities associated with donations management such as uncertainty in both supply and demand, with demand often exceeding supply; the criticality of delivering goods to relief recipients at the right time; the appearance of sudden demand surges due to natural and manmade disasters; and perishability of donated items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research offers substantial benefits to society in terms of improved supply allocation and donations management for non-profit relief agencies. The ability to characterize donor behavior and incorporate the objective of equitably distributing supply enables relief agencies to make informed inventory and supply allocation decisions and strategically target donation solicitations. It also has the potential to enable humanitarian relief organizations to satisfy greater demand by more efficiently allocating available resources, thus impacting human life. The research addresses the critical intersection of humanitarian relief and engineering by linking donations management and food distribution to supply chain management (inventory policy) and forges a relationship necessary to address the significant issues in humanitarian relief in terms of equitable satisfaction of need, cost and human outcomes faced worldwide today.']\n",

In particular, we have focused on issues surrounding the solicitation, coordination, distribution and management of donated goods and its impact on downstream relief recipients. Relief recipients in this sense are those who are food insecure, due to economic or disaster induced events.    Intellectual Merit: This research has produced models that support the efficient and equitable management and distribution of supply in the resource constrained environment of food distribution.  (i) We have developed a novel formulation for food collections and deliveries. This formulation is an extension of the periodic vehicle routing problem and is called the periodic vehicle routing problem with backhauls (PVRPB). While the VRPB has been examined in the literature, our formulation for the PVRPB represents a new contribution to the general vehicle routing literature.   (ii) We have characterized the behavior of in-kinds donations in the non-profit food distribution environment and developed new models to forecast incoming donations from private and public sources.   (iii) We have also identified important economic factors that help characterize the need for food which extends the current measures of food need used by the collaborating partner.  (iv) We have incorporated measures of equity in our optimization models. We have developed deterministic network flow models for maximizing effectiveness in food distribution while maintaining a specified level of equity. We studied the effect of receiving capacities on the optimal food distribution and identify optimal policies for the allocation of additional receiving capacity across the service region.  (v) We have illustrated our results using data from a large food bank in North Carolina.    Broader Impacts: This research offers substantial benefits to society in terms of improved supply allocation and donations management for non-profit relief agencies. The ability to characterize donor behavior and incorporate the objective of equitably distributing supply enables relief agencies to make informed inventory and supply allocation and strategically target donation solicitations. Our research has introduced our partners from a large food bank in North Carolina  to different techniques for analyzing their operations (e.g., forecasting, simulation, and optimization models). We have actually brought our partners to our university and to our classes in addition to taking our students to the partner site.  One local food bank has used our recommended solution to determine how to distribute food to rural counties. Further, the results of this research has been used to inform as well as validate the operational policies used by the food bank.    This research also has the potential to enable humanitarian relief organizations to satisfy greater demand by more efficiently allocating available resources, thus impacting human life. Improving the operations of the food bank has a direct impact on food recipients by helping them to allocate food more efficiently will allows them to distribute food for less cost and eliminate waste and distributed in a fair way. Our research helps them to directly achieve their goal of \"no one going hungry in NC\".    Our research addresses the critical intersection of humanitarian relief and engineering by linking donations management and food distribution to supply chain management (inventory policy) and forges a relationship necessary to address the significant issues in humanitarian relief in terms of equitable satisfaction of need, cost and human outcomes faced worldwide today.

      "['AbstractNarration', 'The research objective of this award is the development of a control theory for cyclic systems and its application and experimental verification. Cyclic systems contain mechanical devices that rotate, along with actuators and sensors that are fixed in inertial space. The combination of rotating motion and inertially-fixed inputs and outputs leads to one-per-revolution (or stroboscopic) actuation and sensing. The research will result in methods that are applicable to xerographic processes, drilling and milling machines, and turbomachinery. The approach of the research is based on so-called circulant matrices, which describe cyclic systems. Each row of a circulant matrix is a circular permutation of the previous row. Fundamental properties of circulant matrices constitute the foundation of the theoretical part of the research; the experimental part is based on the xerographic process. Deliverables include: (1) Methods for mathematical modeling of cyclic systems; (2) Methods for stabilizability, controllability, and observability of cyclic systems; (3) Methods for designing reference tracking and disturbance rejection controllers for cyclic systems; (4) Application of the results obtained to the photoreceptor charging system in xerography to reduce color variation; (5) Experimental verification of the techniques developed; (6) Documentation of the research results; (7) Engineering student education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a methodology for improving performance of rotating devices using feedback control. Indeed, in many instances, high performance of rotating devices is achieved using expensive high quality hardware. Based on the methods to be developed, high performance will be achieved using inexpensive low quality hardware but with stroboscopic feedback control. The results of this research will be disseminated to industrial audiences through short courses. Graduate students involved in this GOALI project will be exposed to industrial environment at Xerox Research Center. Efforts will be made to involve under-represented minorities and women to this project as well as high school students.&lt;br/&gt;']\n",

Preliminary studies have shown that the demand for discretionary purchase items, such as automobiles, apparel, consumer electronics, and home furnishings is correlated with the movement of economic indicators. These findings present an opportunity to use information about market expectations embedded in the prices of financial instruments to improve demand forecasting, production planning, and inventory thus reducing risk. This project aims to establish that the market indicators can be used to plan inventories in supply chains that are optimal not just in a static sense but also dynamically, and to test whether and how the value of the firm is correlated with the economic indicators driving the forecasts. The proposed work also includes the examination of the effect of price information on inventories when the price of the product can be forecasted using prices of traded market instruments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of four parts: forecasting, optimal decision-making, hedging, and empirical validation. If successful, this research will lead to better understanding of the connections between economic factors with supply chain demand and inventory planning. The results will provide a mechanism to inventory planners to use readily available and reliable market information for inventory planning, profit forecasting, and hedging purposes. They also provide a systematic method for developing and testing profit and risk equations using models of supply chains, and allow the enterprises to better understand how the cost of procurement and the volatility of prices and demand affect risk in a simple and joint manner, and thus, the firms will be able to make use of market factors in designing inventory and production systems.&lt;br/&gt;']\n",

Simultaneous small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering will be employed to collect real-time structural data during biaxial stretching conditions which match commercial thermal blown film processing, and during uniaxial stretching for large-strain deformation measurements.  Nanocomposite samples will be characterized before and after the processing and deformation studies using complementary techniques that include transmission electron microscopy, thermal and mechanical property measurements.  These experimental studies will be conducted in close cooperation with a multi-scale modeling research effort to create a predictive tool for designing nanocomposites for a given application.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research will be integrated with graduate and undergraduate education at Georgia Tech and will at the same time provide opportunities for outreach to local high schools.  The proposed research also has broad implications for technologies which are beginning to commercially exploit polymer-silicate nanocomposites in applications from packaging to automotive components.  The empirical development of structure/property relationships in these nanocomposite materials has lead to knowledge of types of morphologies that can be formed from different starting recipes, and how this relates to their observed properties.  Despite this, relatively little is known about how nanocomposite morphologies reach their characteristic forms during processing, nor how these structures deform under large-scale deformation to fracture.  This knowledge, which is needed to complement the comprehensive modeling studies being undertaken by our collaborators, can be provided by conducting in-situ studies of nanocomposite processing and deformation.  &lt;br/&gt;']\n",

Ross &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New technologies, interdisciplinary studies, and the urgency of global change make Earth system science (ESS) one of the fastest evolving areas of science. Unfortunately, the general public has little understanding of the breadth and significance of ESS research. Museums and science centers, which nationally receive over 100 million visits per year, are ideal venues for educating the public. Yet many museums present out-of-date Earth science information using antiquated approaches, and many museum professionals are not satisfied with the coverage of ESS in their current exhibits. The absence of readily available models of best practices, and of networks for communication among providers of informal geoscience education, has contributed to these problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning project is developing a detailed plan for producing the resources necessary to inform the general public about current ESS research using informal education venues. The project involves a multiyear collaboration among six major providers of informal geoscience education. The current status of informal geoscience education is being evaluated, and a white paper summary of recommendations is being prepared. A DLESE collection for informal geoscience education is being developed to disseminate the results of the project to the geoscience community at large.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is being evaluated to determine the effectiveness of traveling exhibits and plans for exhibits and programming, all of which are being designed for broad utility. The project, both through communication among the six core collaborators and networking among many dozens of other entities, is expected to improve the quality of geoscience exhibits and programming nationwide. &lt;br/&gt;']\n",

The implications of such pull-outs on surface quality and integrity of wire sawed wafers will also be investigated. A combination of analytical and numerical simulations will be pursued. A fluid-structure interaction model will be developed for long wavelength waviness generation, and a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis will be pursued for predictions of diamond pull-out conditions. Simulation results will be verified against experimental observations under laboratory conditions. Verified mechanistic models will then be utilized to develop integrated process models and control algorithms for the wire sawing process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current wire sawing method of wafer slicing leaves a long wavelength waviness on the wafer surface that must be corrected by an expensive lapping process. If successful, this project will improve the wire sawing process to greatly reduce the induced waviness, thereby reducing the need for lapping, and enhancing the cost effectiveness of wafer production. Abrasive pull-out affects the performance of grinding wheels, and a mechanistic model of this phenomenon will aid in grinding process design as well.  These results will be of considerable value to the integrated circuit industry, particularly as the industry goes to bigger wafer diameters and finer circuit structures.']\n",

Gutierrez, Temple University&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0300004&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematical research focuses on problems for nonlinear equations of Monge-Ampere type and represents a natural continuation of the work done by the PI under previous grants. The problems concentrate on the study of geometric and regularity properties of solutions to Monge-Ampere type equations. In particular, a question proposed is about the regularity of generalized solutions for an equation that appears in geometric optics for the synthesis of reflector antennae. A more general Monge-Ampere type equation that will be investigated appears naturally from mass transportation problems. We propose to develop a theory of generalized solutions and regularity for such equations. The general methodology that we plan to use to solve this set of problems consists of appropriate maximum principles for non-divergence form operators related to vector fields are of interest due to the fact that standard methods do not apply. We proposed a new approach based on integration by parts that we proved successful in the model example of the Heisenberg group, which appears in the applications to a model of human vision.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed problems include its connections and applications within several areas in mathematics and outside. Mass transportation problems are concerned with the optimal transport of masses from one location to another, where the optimality depends upon the context of the problem. The problems appear in several forms and in various areas of mathematics and its applications: economics, probability theory, optimization, meteorology, and computer graphics. In economics they appear in planning problems at the level of an industry, a region, the whole national economy as well as the analysis of the structure of economic indices. And several different problems such as work distribution for equipment, the best use of sowing area, use of complex resources, distribution of transport flows, have a similar mathematical form. The understanding of the properties of optimal maps has also possible implications in numerical computations. The work proposed involves collaborations with mathematicians in the US and abroad, and it will contribute a great deal to the training of graduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', 'This project is concerned with the geometry of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;varieites. It builds on past experience which indicates that &lt;br/&gt;much can be learned about the geometry of a given algebraic &lt;br/&gt;variety by studying its Chow group. The Chow group is obtained &lt;br/&gt;from the free abelian group on all subvarieties of a given variety &lt;br/&gt;by modding out by the relation of rational equivalence. For &lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves the Chow group is a close relative of the &lt;br/&gt;Jacobian. While the Chow group is known to have good functorial &lt;br/&gt;properties, it is often very difficult to compute. Thus it is &lt;br/&gt;difficult to gain access to the subtle and valuable information &lt;br/&gt;that it frequently contains. This investigation focuses on three &lt;br/&gt;different aspects of the problem of computing Chow groups. First &lt;br/&gt;the torsion subgroup of the Chow group is being studied with an &lt;br/&gt;emphasis on the quotient by the subgroup generated by cycles &lt;br/&gt;algebraically equivalent to zero. Secondly, the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between the Chow group and singular cohomology with rational &lt;br/&gt;coefficients is being investigated. The Hodge Conjecture is an &lt;br/&gt;important concern here. The theory of Abelian varieties and &lt;br/&gt;techniques from classical algebraic geometry will be brought to &lt;br/&gt;bear on this problem.  The third line of investigation involves &lt;br/&gt;the relationship between the Chow group and singular cohomology &lt;br/&gt;with integrer coefficients. An ancient guidepost here was the so &lt;br/&gt;called Integral Hodge Conjecture. It has turned out that the &lt;br/&gt;Integral Hodge Conjecture is false in some instances. The extent &lt;br/&gt;of its failure is poorly understood, so the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;and a PhD student are working to clarify this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To a significant extent, the value of basic research in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry results from the tendency of mathematicians to reduce &lt;br/&gt;problems in various other fields of mathematics to problems in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. This tendency is due to the ultimate &lt;br/&gt;simplicity of algebraic geometry, where remarkably effective &lt;br/&gt;approaches to certain geometric problems have been developed&lt;br/&gt;with minimal reliance on infinite processes. While the initial &lt;br/&gt;translation of a problem from the physical world into mathematics &lt;br/&gt;frequently involves limits, derivatives, integrals, and further &lt;br/&gt;notions involving infinite processes which go well beyond ordinary &lt;br/&gt;calculus, mathematicians have learned to search for hidden aspects &lt;br/&gt;of these problems which are essentially of an algebraic or finite &lt;br/&gt;nature.  Neither the task of translating real world phenomena into &lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems, the task of discovering a hidden algebraic&lt;br/&gt;core in a problem formulated using infinite processes, nor the &lt;br/&gt;task of solving this core problem using algebraic geometry is&lt;br/&gt;often easy. Nonetheless, this lengthy process has led to profound &lt;br/&gt;insights.  For example, algebraic geometry and some of the &lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties studied by the principal investigator are of &lt;br/&gt;great interest to physicists in their current attempts to unify &lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanics with the theory of gravity.']\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', '0100009&lt;br/&gt;Gidley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interdisciplinary research program is proposed that combines the well-known void-volume sensitivity of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) with state-of-the-art positron beam technology in order to characterize defects and pores in a wide range of engineering materials where traditional techniques are not adequate. Porosity control is an important aspect of the emerging field of nanoengineering. Introducing and engineering porosity in microelectronic \"low-K\" dielectric films, in thin polymeric permeation filters, and in catalytic films is attracting intense research interest. On the other hand, preventing interfacial defect porosity is a long-standing problem in structural materials such as adhesives, encapsulants, and composites. Traditional probes are challenged by the amorphous nature of these very thin films and by the nanoscale size of the pores/defects. PALS has been demonstrated to be an important new tool in characterizing nanoscale porosity in such sub-micron film systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of the previous NSF-ECS grant beam-PALS is playing an important role in helping the microelectronics industry develop next-generation, low-K interlayer dielectric films. The sensitivity of PALS to the size and interconnectivity of 1-100 nanometer pores has been demonstrated. A procedure for extracting pore size distributions for closed-pore systems has been developed. PALS is found to be sensitive to Cu interdiffusion into the dielectric and the consequently required diffusion barrier layer integrity can be tested as well. This proposal will expand upon this work. Metal interdiffusion and barrier integrity/thermal stability will be studied with particular attention focussed on developing a standardized PALS testing procedure as requested by Sematech, a research consortium primarily comprised of the major U.S. electronics corporations. Cross-calibration experiments with complementary techniques used to characterize porosity, such as small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) at NIST and solvent absorption ellipsometric porosimetry at IMEC, will be continued. Such studies help determine the unique strengths and weaknesses of each respective technique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second major thrust of this proposal will be the study of polymer thin films, surfaces and interfaces. Ibis research builds upon previous work in which beam-PALS was used to study the structure and dynamics of thin 10 urn polymer films constrained on silicon wafers. Such films were found to have a highly immobile \"adhesive\" layer next to the silicon and an unconstrained \"liquid\" layer at the surface. Particular attention will be focussed on the interfacial regions in order to determine the sensitivity of the immobile layer to the onset of adhesion failure and delamination. If failure is due to the coalescence of precursor nano-voids into larger pores due, for example, to fatigue, thermal stress, or corrosion, depth-profiled beam-PALS should be a very powerful probe of this pre-failure initiation phase that is otherwise invisible. Specifically, the role of defect voids in the failure of polymer encapsulants and adhesives used in microelectronic packaging will be studied. An ancillary study of the evolution of nanostructure in a chemically amplified photo-resist as it develops under UV exposure will also be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research builds upon a strong existing collaboration between the University of Michigan Physics Department and the Materials Science and Engineering Department. To provide critical guidance and clear focus on relevance the PIs have developed strong working collaborations with six individual companies, NIST, and with two large industrial consortiums; Sematech in the U.S. and IMEC in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;']\n",

The   mathematical  structure   of   continuum  thermoplasticity  is exploited for macroscopic  modeling  of  superelasticity and shape memory effect. Solid -solid  phase  transitions  are associated with yield-like functions  while  rate  type  constitutive equations are  postulated  for  the  evolution  of inelastic strain and hardening like variables.  The  stress response is derived from a specific free  energy  function  calculated as a weighted average of specific  free  energies  of  all  active  phases  plus  the  free  energies  associated  with  the  transformations  between  them.   The  systems  analyzed here have numerous important  applications  in   bioengineering   and  in  the  control   of   composite  intelligent structures.  ***']\n",

The objective of their research is to study the protein folding problem.  Specifically, they will investigate pathways by which fragments of E. Coli thioredoxin reconstitute the original structure of macromolecules.  Through the study of the function of thioredoxin, they propose to elucidate structure and the protein folding pathway.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in structural studies and approaches.  This is complemented by the French investigators' expertise in kinetic studies of protein folding.  The research will advance our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in biological macromolecules.\"]\n",

      "['AbstractNarration', '9500006  Wang   This award for a Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project will develop a new methodology for reducing geometric variation in aluminum automotive space frames.  The space frame structures are fabricated in a \"Tinker Toy\" manner from aluminum extrusions, and they promise light weight, very good strength and crash worthiness.  Tight geometric variation targets of less than 0.5 mm are are to assure good fit-up when these structures are joined, so they reach their full strength potential when used to fabricate features like door openings.  The technical approach will use measurements of the structural shapes made with a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), parameterizing this data as deviaitons form a geometric model of the desired structural form, and from this representation identify the needs for process improvement, modify tooling using rapid prototyping technology, and predicting tolerance stackup.  Two of the types of problems that will be attacked that involve curvature: in one case nominally straight extrusions that have a bow, and in the other curved extrusions that have deviations from the design curvature or possibly multiple bends.  This work began as a GOALI/EFI award with ALCOA in FY94, and this collaboration will continue with this research project.   This will enable high volume manufacture of these light weight, structural frame members that contribute to safety and fuel economy in automobiles, aircraft, or where there are important strength to weight tradeoffs.  ***']\n",

Biologists have long been interested in determining what factors or processes regulate or control population size. Recently, the effect of human activities in decreasing the abundance of some species has become more apparent. With increasing interest in protecting biological diversity has come an attempt to identify the factors affecting the survival of rare and endangered species. This research investigates the effects of population size on the performance of individual plants within those populations. Two species of thistle occurring in the mountains of New Mexico will be studied: one a rare species (protected as a federally Threatened species) and the other a more common thistle of similar environments. Populations of different sizes (ranging from 10 to over 3000 individuals) will be selected from known populations of the rare species; individual plants within these populations will be monitored. Similar observation will be carried out on artificial populations of the common species, which will be established with plants transplanted by the investigator. Estimates of the rates of survival, seed production, and so on in these populations will be used in computer models to assess the viability (the chances for continued persistence) of extremely small populations of the threatened species. This research will shed light on the processes that regulate population size in plants, both common and rare. The research will also test methods for assessing the viability of small populations. Such techniques are essential for land managers and government agencies making decisions about which species or populations are worthy candidates for conservation efforts.']\n",

Variation in                    the sizes of populations prior to exploitation, minimal                         population size during exploitation and current population                      sizes permit analyses of the effects of differing levels of                     exploitation on species with different biogeographical                          distributions and life-history characteristics.  Dr. Stephen                    Palumbi at the University of Hawaii will study the genetic                      population structure of three whale species in this context,                    the Humpback Whale, the Gray Whale and the Bowhead Whale.  The                  effect of demographic history will be determined by comparing                   the genetic structure of the three species.  Additional studies                 will be carried out on the Humpback Whale.  The humpback has a                  world-wide distribution, but the Atlantic and Pacific                           populations of the northern hemisphere appear to be discrete                    populations, as is the population of the southern hemispheric                   oceans.  Each of these oceanic populations may be further                       subdivided into smaller isolates, each with its own migratory                   pattern and somewhat distinct gene pool.  This study will                       provide information on the level of genetic isolation among                     populations and the levels of gene flow and genealogical                        relationships among populations.  This detailed genetic                         information will facilitate international policy decisions                      regarding the conservation and management of these magnificent                  mammals.']\n",

       " 'AbstractNarration': 'The objective of this collaborative research project is to investigate the process of electrowetting on dielectric as an advanced manufacturing technology for tissue engineering.  An electrowetting-based microfluidics array printing system will be created to rapidly print chitosan hydrogel and other biomaterials to build micro porous scaffolds with predefined structures, cells, and growth factors. The project addresses fundamental challenges to biocompatible dispensing of hydrogels, living cells, and growth factors, to mimic tissue extra cellular matrix architecture and support cell proliferation. Specifically, the investigators will: (1)  characterize chitosan hydrogel, in terms of its mechanical strength, rheology, solidification, manufacturability, biocompatibility, and ability to support cell proliferation; (2)  model, design, and demonstrate the generation of sub-nanoliter hydrogel droplets from an on-chip reservoir through electrowetting, addressing issues of biocompatibility and droplet dispensing; and (3)  demonstrate and characterize the sterility, biocompatibility, and manufacturing precision of an intelligent system including software control, actuation, multiple reservoirs, and printing arrays, to manufacture scaffolds based on a computer-aided design model of myocardial tissue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will enable tissue engineers to optimize mechanical, transport, material, and biological properties of a soft tissue engineering scaffold, with a degree of structural control, fine resolution (&lt;10 microns) and embedded cells and growth factors not currently available. In this project, a group of graduate and undergraduate senior students will be trained in advanced manufacturing technology and tissue engineering.  Several project-based learning modules will be created to strengthen the undergraduate mechanical and biomedical engineering curricula. The project will also be used in outreach workshops for local high school and community college students, including many underrepresented minority students, to showcase high-tech mechanical and electrical engineering applications in biotechnology.',\n",
